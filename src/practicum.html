                <li>
                    <strong>Blazor and .NET Development:</strong> During my OJT, I gained extensive hands-on experience in using Blazor and .NET for building interactive web applications. This framework allowed me to create responsive user interfaces and implement complex functionalities efficiently. I learned about the lifecycle of Blazor components and how to manage state effectively within the application. Additionally, the integration with .NET provided a robust backend framework that streamlined development processes. Overall, this experience significantly enhanced my web development skills and confidence in using modern technologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Database Design and Oracle SQL:</strong> I developed a solid understanding of database design principles while working with Oracle SQL. This involved creating efficient schemas that support various data relationships and ensure data integrity. I learned to write complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data effectively, which is crucial for any application. Moreover, designing databases with scalability in mind prepared me for future projects that may require additional features or modifications. This experience was invaluable in enhancing my technical capabilities in database management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Migration:</strong> A significant part of my project involved migrating data from Excel to a structured database, which required careful planning and execution. This process highlighted the importance of data accuracy and integrity during transitions, as any errors could lead to major issues later on. I developed scripts to automate parts of the migration, ensuring a smoother and more efficient transfer of information. Through this experience, I gained insights into data mapping and transformation techniques essential for successful migrations. Ultimately, this reinforced the importance of thorough data handling practices in any IT project.

                    <strong>Documentation is Key:</strong> Throughout my internship, I realized the critical role documentation plays in the success of any project. Thorough documentation facilitates better understanding among team members, ensuring everyone is aligned with the project goals and processes. It serves as a valuable resource for future reference, helping new team members onboard more efficiently. Furthermore, well-maintained documentation aids in tracking changes and decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. Ultimately, this realization emphasized the need for consistent documentation practices in all my future endeavors.

                <li>
                    <strong>Focus on Non-Coding Tasks:</strong> I came to understand that dedicating a significant portion of my efforts to non-coding tasks is essential for successful project outcomes. This includes activities such as planning, designing, and refining processes, which are often just as important as actual coding. Investing time in these areas helps to identify potential challenges early on and ensures a smoother development process. Additionally, this focus contributes to the overall quality of the final product, making it more robust and user-friendly. This realization has reshaped my approach to project management and execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Solidify Processes First:</strong> One of the key insights I gained is the necessity of solidifying processes before entering the development phase. Establishing clear and well-defined processes helps avoid complications and sets a solid foundation for the project. It ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings later on. By having robust processes in place, the development team can work more efficiently and effectively towards common goals. This understanding will significantly influence my approach in future projects.
